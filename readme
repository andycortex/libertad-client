* next setup custom server
* to use cookie based auth system we need have both client and server running on same origin / domain

/** 
* use proxy in nextjs
* to use proxy we need to create custom server
* this is only for development mode
* in production, we will use same origin / domain so we don't have to worry about it
* we can simply run build then start next app

/** 
* server
* to login user we need to check if user's password is correct
* we need to take user's password, hash it then compare with the hashed password saved
* then we need to generate json web token / JWT and send to client
* this will be used to access protected routes

/** 
protect route
* create a protected page and restrict onlu to logged in user with valid tokens
* to verify if token is valid, you need to send request to backend 
* (browser will include cookie in header automatically)
* if you get successful response then you can show the protected page to the user
